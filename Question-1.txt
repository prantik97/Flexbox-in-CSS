Ql. Describe the main differences between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model. When
would you choose to use one over the other?

Difference Between Grid and Flexbox:

1. Dimensionality and Flexibility:

Flexbox offers greater control over alignment and space distribution between items. Being one-dimensional, Flexbox only 
deals with either columns or rows.
Grid has two-dimension layout capabilities which allow flexible widths as a unit of length. This compensates for the 
limitations in Flex.

2. Alignment:

Flex Direction allows developers to align elements vertically or horizontally, which is used when developers create and 
reverse rows or columns.
CSS Grid deploys fractional measure units for grid fluidity and auto-keyword functionality to automatically adjust 
columns or rows.

3. Item Management

Flex Container is the parent element while Flex Item represents the children. The Flex Container can ensure balanced 
representation by adjusting item dimensions. This allows developers to design for fluctuating screen sizes.
Grid supports both implicit and explicit content placement. Its inbuilt automation allows it to automatically extend 
line items and copy values into the new creation from the preceding item.

When I would choose to use one over the other:

CSS Grid is for layout; Flexbox is for alignment
CSS Grid really came to help us build more complex layout designs using a two-dimensional way, using both rows and 
columns. We should aim to use both of them together, but for different purposes. For your layout, use CSS Grid, 
for alignment of your elements, use Flexbox.
